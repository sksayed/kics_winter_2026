ABSTRACT With the advancement of quantum computing, classical public-key cryptosystems are
increasingly vulnerable, prompting global standardization efforts by organizations such as NIST, ETSI, and
ISO. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in post-quantum cryptography
(PQC), with a particular focus on lattice-based, hash-based, and multivariate approaches. The study examines
the security foundations, implementation challenges, and the applicability of these approaches across various
domains, including finance, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). A key contribution of this
work is the proposed Hybrid Cryptographic Framework (HCF), which integrates classical and quantum-
resistant primitives, facilitating a secure and interoperable transition. This framework combines hybrid
key exchange mechanisms, dual-signature schemes, and PQC-compatible Merkle trees, supported by a
discrete multi-objective optimization model to select algorithms that meet real-world constraints. The paper
also addresses deployment challenges, such as hardware acceleration, side-channel resistance, and legacy
system compatibility. Real-world case studies demonstrate how leading institutions are actively piloting
PQC integration. Finally, we present a strategic roadmap for the adoption of PQC, incorporating adaptive
triggers based on quantum capabilities and evolving threat models. By aligning cryptographic design
with international standards and practical system requirements, this paper provides valuable guidance for
constructing resilient, quantum-safe infrastructures.

I. INTRODUCTION
Rapid progress in quantum computing poses a significant
threat to conventional cryptographic methods. Public-key
schemes such as RSA and ECC, which are based on
mathematically challenging problems—specifically, integer
factorization and discrete logarithm computations—are vul-
nerable to quantum techniques, particularly Shor’s algorithm,
which can efficiently solve these problems [1]. As a result,
this emerging vulnerability has spurred efforts to develop and
standardize post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to ensure the
long-term security of digital infrastructures.
The associate editor coordinating the review of this manuscript and
approving it for publication was Yiming Tang
 .
Although prior research has explored various aspects
of PQC, including its theoretical foundations [2], security
frameworks [3], and practical implementation strategies [4],
there remains a notable gap in comprehensive reviews that
integrate the standardization process, industry-wide adoption,
and the practical challenges associated with deployment.
The motivation for this study arises from the urgent need
to assess the readiness of PQC for real-world applications,
especially in light of global standardization efforts. Standards
from organizations such as NIST, ETSI, and ISO are actively
shaping strategies for PQC adoption. Thus, we position this
review not only as a technical evaluation of algorithms but
also as a strategic roadmap aligned with evolving global
standards.

Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
Additionally, retrofitting PQC into existing infrastruc-
tures presents practical challenges, including limitations in
latency, energy consumption, memory usage, and protocol
compatibility. To facilitate a smoother transition to quantum-
resistant architectures, we propose a Hybrid Cryptographic
Framework (HCF) that integrates classical cryptographic
primitives with NIST-approved PQC algorithms. This hybrid
approach ensures backward compatibility and allows for
incremental migration without compromising long-term
security.
In contrast to previous surveys, this review addresses
several gaps. While Fernández-Caramés and Fraga-Lamas [5]
focus primarily on blockchain-oriented PQC strategies, our
paper adopts a broader perspective, encompassing finance,
IoT, and other cross-domain deployments. Sabrina et al. [6]
concentrate on privacy preservation in the Internet of
Medical Things (IoMT) using SPHINCS + and blockchain;
however, we evaluate multiple NIST-approved algorithms
across diverse application domains and discuss deployment
trade-offs. Yalamuri et al. [7] provide a classification of
post-quantum cryptographic techniques but do not assess
algorithm performance or propose integration strategies.
Zeydan et al. [8] examine PQC in networking environments,
whereas our review develops a hybrid cryptographic roadmap
that bridges the gap between theoretical models and practical
deployment across heterogeneous infrastructures.
This paper seeks to fill that gap by systematically
analyzing developments in PQC, focusing on international
standardization efforts led by NIST, ETSI, ISO, and IETF,
while also evaluating the security-performance trade-offs of
leading NIST-approved PQC schemes. Beyond theoretical
advancements, the adoption of PQC presents significant
challenges across various industries, including finance,
blockchain, and IoT. Integrating PQC into existing infras-
tructures introduces computational overhead, increased key
and signature sizes, and interoperability concerns. Hybrid
cryptographic frameworks, which combine classical and
post-quantum schemes, provide a transitional approach,
but require careful optimization to balance security and
efficiency.
In comparison to prior surveys, such as those by
Bernstein et al. and the NIST reports, our review offers
several unique contributions that set it apart:
1) Comprehensive Evaluation Across Key Application
Domains: Unlike many previous surveys that primarily
focus on theoretical aspects or algorithmic comparisons,
our review emphasizes the practical challenges of
deploying PQC schemes in real-world systems, such
as blockchain, IoT, and financial services. We examine
how PQC schemes are being integrated into these
industries and provide insights into the integration
challenges posed by existing infrastructure.
2) Quantified Performance Trade-offs : This paper goes
beyond general descriptions of performance and pro-
vides a specific quantitative analysis of security-
performance trade-offs. For example, we quantify the
impact of Kyber-768 on TLS handshake latency, show-
ing a 15–20% increase compared to RSA, and compare
Falcon-512’s verification time with Dilithium-3, which
is ideal for blockchain applications.
3) Hybrid Cryptographic Frameworks : While earlier
surveys mention hybrid cryptography, our review delves
deeper into the potential of hybrid cryptographic
frameworks, which combine classical and post-quantum
schemes to enable a smoother transition in industries
such as finance and blockchain.
4) Focus on Real-World Deployment Challenges : Our
review addresses challenges such as hardware accel-
eration and the computational overhead in IoT envi-
ronments. These practical aspects are often overlooked
in earlier works, which focus more on cryptographic
theory.
5) Strategic Roadmap for Transitioning to Quantum-
Safe Systems : We propose a comprehensive roadmap
that guides industries on how to transition to quantum-
safe cryptographic infrastructures. This
roadmap emphasizes both theoretical and practical
solutions for achieving long-term security in the
quantum computing era.
In summary, while prior surveys focus primarily on theo-
retical foundations and algorithmic performance, our review
distinguishes itself by offering a more application-oriented
approach, addressing real-world deployment challenges,
quantifying performance trade-offs, and proposing hybrid
cryptographic frameworks for a seamless transition.
This paper also reviews the PQC standardization timeline,
highlighting key milestones from algorithm submissions to
final selections. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the evolution of
PQC standardization and the suitability of various algorithms
for different applications. Additionally, Table 1 categorizes
their adoption across financial services, blockchain security,
and IoT, addressing domain-specific security and perfor-
mance needs.

The key contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) a
comprehensive review of PQC standardization and industry
adoption strategies, (2) an evaluation of security-performance
trade-offs among PQC algorithms, and (3) an identification of
major challenges and research directions, including hardware
acceleration, hybrid cryptographic frameworks, and global
standard harmonization.

II. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS AND QUANTUM
THREAT MODELING
The advent of quantum computing has prompted a fundamen-
tal reevaluation of cryptographic foundations to ensure long-
term security. Classical cryptographic schemes, particularly
RSA and ECC, derive their security from the computa-
tional intractability of integer factorization and discrete
logarithm problems, respectively. However, with the devel-
opment of large-scale quantum computers, these assumptions
can no longer be relied upon. This section provides a
mathematical framework for understanding post-quantum
cryptography (PQC), evaluates recent advancements in
quantum computing—including challenges in quantum error
correction—and examines emerging threats posed by quan-
tum cryptanalysis, including hybrid quantum-classical attack
models.
A. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATIONS OF POST-QUANTUM
CRYPTOGRAPHY
PQC is based on computational problems that are believed
to be resistant to quantum attacks. Unlike traditional cryp-
tographic paradigms, PQC does not depend on problems
vulnerable to Shor’s algorithm. Instead, it leverages mathe-
matical structures that remain computationally hard, even for
quantum computers. The primary mathematical foundations
of PQC are as follows:
1) LATTICE-BASED CRYPTOGRAPHY
Lattice-based cryptography derives its security from difficult
mathematical problems, such as the Learning With Errors
(LWE) problem and the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), both
of which are NP-hard. These problems remain difficult for
both classical and quantum computers. The National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) has standardized Kyber,
a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), and Dilithium,
a digital signature scheme, both of which are based on lattice
structures.
2) CODE-BASED CRYPTOGRAPHY
Code-based cryptography relies on the difficulty of decoding
random linear codes, particularly Goppa codes. One of
the most well-known cryptosystems in this category is the
McEliece encryption scheme, which, despite its large public
key sizes, has demonstrated strong security over several
decades.
3) HASH-BASED CRYPTOGRAPHY
Hash-based cryptographic schemes rely on the security
of cryptographic hash functions. A notable example is
SPHINCS+, which is designed to be resistant to quantum
attacks. The only known quantum advantage in this domain
arises from Grover’s algorithm, which provides a quadratic
speedup in brute-force search.
4) MULTIVARIATE CRYPTOGRAPHY
Multivariate cryptography is based on the difficulty of
solving systems of multivariate quadratic equations. While
this approach has been extensively studied, some proposed
schemes, such as Rainbow, have recently been broken, raising
concerns regarding their long-term security.
5) ISOGENY-BASED CRYPTOGRAPHY
Isogeny-based cryptography relies on the complexity of
computing isogenies between elliptic curves. This approach
was initially considered a strong candidate for post-quantum
security. However, recent classical attacks have significantly
undermined confidence in schemes such as SIKE.
B. ADVANCES IN QUANTUM COMPUTING AND THEIR
CRYPTOGRAPHIC IMPACT
Recent advancements in quantum computing have sig-
nificantly impacted cryptographic security models. Key
milestones in quantum hardware development include:
Despite these advances, current quantum computers
remain far from achieving the fault-tolerant, large-scale archi-
tectures required to break modern cryptographic protocols.
Achieving fault tolerance necessitates significant quantum
error correction, which substantially increases resource

requirements. Current research suggests that breaking
RSA-2048 would require at least 20 million physical qubits
in addition to extensive error correction, making large-scale
cryptanalysis infeasible in the near term [1].
Table 2 illustrates key milestones in quantum hardware
but also highlights their limitations. For instance, although
Google’s Sycamore demonstrated quantum supremacy, it did
so for a narrow class of problems and lacks error correction.
IonQ Forte, with longer coherence time, shows promise for
future scalability, but its limited qubit count underscores the
current technological gap. These observations suggest that
large-scale quantum threats remain theoretical in the short
term, despite visible progress in hardware capabilities.
C. QUANTUM THREATS AND THE TRANSITION TO PQC
Assessing the urgency of transitioning to post-quantum
cryptography requires an evaluation of key quantum threats.
Shor’s algorithm enables exponential speedups in integer
factorization and discrete logarithm problems, making RSA
and elliptic curve cryptography vulnerable once sufficiently
powerful quantum computers become available.
Grover’s algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for brute-
force search, which affects symmetric cryptography such
as AES. While AES-256 remains theoretically secure, its
effective security is reduced to AES-128 under quantum
attacks.
Hybrid quantum-classical attack models, which combine
lattice reduction techniques with quantum optimizations,
have been explored. Although these models suggest potential
vulnerabilities in lattice-based cryptography, such attacks
remain theoretical due to current limitations in quantum
hardware and error correction [9].
Table 3 shows the quantum resources required to break
common cryptographic schemes. While RSA-2048 and
ECC-256 are vulnerable within hours using sufficiently
powerful quantum computers, Kyber-768 remains infeasible,
underscoring the need for continued research into post-
quantum security.
TABLE 3. Quantum resources required for cryptographic breaks.
The results in Table 3 provide a compelling comparison
of classical and post-quantum security. While RSA-2048
and ECC-256 would be broken within hours using suffi-
ciently powerful quantum computers, Kyber-768’s resistance
requires an astronomically high gate count—far beyond any
foreseeable quantum capabilities. This contrast highlights the
practical security margin offered by lattice-based cryptogra-
phy and supports its inclusion in global standards such as
those developed by NIST.
D. GLOBAL STANDARDIZATION AND PQC TRANSITION
STRATEGIES
The transition to post-quantum cryptography requires not
only the development of robust cryptographic schemes but
also the adaptation of large-scale infrastructures. Global
organizations have adopted diverse migration strategies,
summarized in Table 4.
TABLE 4. PQC standardization efforts across regions.
The United States plans to deploy Kyber and Dilithium
for key exchange and digital signatures in the financial
and governmental sectors by 2025. Europe, through ETSI,
is evaluating BIKE and FrodoKEM for telecommunications
security, favoring code-based and lattice-based approaches.
China aims to implement LAC, a lightweight lattice-based
encryption scheme, for domestic adoption by 2026. Japan’s
CRYPTREC initiative continues to assess NTRU Prime,
though the approach remains cautious. Interoperability
among these standards presents a challenge, and ongoing
research into hybrid cryptographic frameworks is crucial to
ensuring a secure transition.
As shown in Table 4, regional preferences for PQC
schemes vary considerably, which could hinder global
interoperability. While the U.S. has selected lattice-based
algorithms such as Kyber and Dilithium, ETSI has chosen
code-based alternatives like BIKE. China’s lightweight
lattice-based LAC reflects the constraints of domestic
deployment, while Japan remains more conservative. These
discrepancies underscore the importance of harmonization
efforts and hybrid frameworks to bridge technical and
regulatory gaps.
III. EVALUATION CRITERIA FOR POST-QUANTUM
CRYPTOGRAPHY
As quantum computing continues to progress, traditional
cryptographic protocols face increasing vulnerabilities due to
VOLUME 13, 2025 112965
Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
their susceptibility to quantum attacks. Post-quantum cryp-
tography (PQC) aims to develop schemes that remain secure
against quantum adversaries while ensuring long-term digital
security. Evaluating PQC algorithms requires a multifaceted
approach, considering factors such as theoretical secu-
rity, computational complexity, hardware efficiency, energy
consumption, and adaptability to real-world environments,
including financial transactions, blockchain, and the Internet
of Things (IoT). Although this survey does not present
experimental data, the analysis is grounded in theoretical
assessments and performance benchmarks reported in the
literature.
A. SECURITY AND COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
1) THEORETICAL SECURITY FOUNDATIONS
A critical component of PQC evaluation is the analysis of
the underlying hardness assumptions and resistance to known
quantum attacks. The current NIST-standardized algorithms
rely on problems considered intractable for both classical and
quantum computers:
• Lattice-based cryptography relies on the Learning
With Errors (LWE) problem and the Shortest Vector
Problem (SVP), both believed to be quantum-resistant.
• Code-based cryptography depends on the difficulty of
decoding random linear codes, as exemplified by the
McEliece cryptosystem.
• Hash-based cryptography utilizes secure hash func-
tions, with security limited by Grover’s algorithm, which
provides only a quadratic speedup.
• Multivariate cryptography is based on solving sys-
tems of nonlinear multivariate equations, though some
schemes, such as Rainbow, have recently been broken.
2) COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY AND THEORETICAL
PERFORMANCE
PQC schemes exhibit diverse performance characteristics,
including key sizes, latency, and computational cost. The
operational complexity is typically expressed as :
Top = O(nc · logd q), (1)
where n represents the security parameter, q is the modulus,
and c, d are constants determined by the algorithm design.
Table 5 provides a summary of the theoretical performance
data for selected NIST-standardized schemes [11], [12], [13].
Table 5 provides a comparative view of key parameters,
including key size, signature size, and computation latency.
These values are critical for selecting appropriate algorithms
based on specific application requirements. For example,
McEliece exhibits an impractically large public key size
(261 KB), limiting its usability in low-bandwidth or storage-
constrained environments. In contrast, Falcon-512 stands
out due to its exceptionally low signing time (0.3 ms) and
compact signature size (0.7 KB), making it highly suitable for
latency-sensitive applications such as blockchain or real-time
IoT systems.
Kyber-768 offers robust security but introduces a 15-20%
increase in TLS handshake latency compared to RSA. While
this may impact high-frequency financial systems, its strong
resistance to quantum attacks makes it a viable option for
future-proof cryptographic protocols.
Dilithium-3 provides strong security guarantees but gen-
erates larger signatures (2.4 KB), which could increase
transmission overhead, particularly in resource-constrained
environments. Meanwhile, SPHINCS + offers strong hash-
based security but suffers from impractically high signing
latency and large output sizes, limiting its adoption in real-
time applications.
These findings highlight the importance of aligning
the selection of PQC schemes with specific application
constraints, balancing factors such as latency, bandwidth,
computational resources, and security levels.
B. HARDWARE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY
1) HARDWARE ACCELERATION AND OPTIMIZATION
For real-world deployment, hardware efficiency plays a
crucial role. Literature benchmarks indicate that lattice-based
schemes (e.g., Kyber, Falcon) generally outperform hash-
based schemes in terms of both memory footprint and
execution time [14].
2) ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN IoT DEVICES
Battery-powered devices require algorithms with low energy
consumption. Table 6 presents energy benchmarks for key
PQC operations in IoT contexts.
Table 6 illustrates the trade-off between security and
energy efficiency. Falcon-512 has the lowest energy con-
sumption (0.09 mJ), making it ideal for constrained devices.
In contrast, SPHINCS + requires over 12 mJ per signature,
which poses significant energy challenges in IoT environ-
ments.
C. NETWORK AND FINANCIAL ADAPTABILITY
1) TLS AND INTERNET SECURITY
Integrating PQC into TLS and similar protocols presents
several deployment challenges. For instance, Kyber-768
increases handshake latency by 15-20% compared to
ECDH [16]. Hybrid cryptography offers a transitional
solution that helps mitigate these performance costs.
2) BLOCKCHAIN AND FINANCIAL SERVICES
Blockchain and fintech systems require high verification
speeds. Falcon-512, with its rapid signature validation,
is particularly well-suited for such applications. Studies
indicate it can reduce verification time by 35-45% compared
to Dilithium-3 [15].
These findings underscore the role of Falcon-512 in
blockchain ecosystems, where latency directly impacts
transaction throughput and scalability. Conversely, Dilithium
may be preferable in applications where signature size is less
critical than security assurances.

D. STANDARDIZATION AND FUTURE CHALLENGES
1) NIST STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS
NIST has standardized several PQC schemes :
• FIPS 203: Kyber (KEM)
• FIPS 204: Dilithium (Signatures)
• FIPS 205: Falcon (High-speed signatures)
2) HYBRID CRYPTOGRAPHIC APPROACHES
To ensure a smooth transition, hybrid methods are being
adopted. Examples include :
• ECDH + Kyber: Hybrid key exchange
• ECDSA + Dilithium: Hybrid signature schemes
These hybrid configurations facilitate the gradual inte-
gration of PQC while preserving compatibility with legacy
systems. They are particularly relevant in critical infrastruc-
ture, where protocol changes must occur incrementally.
In summary, this section illustrates how performance
metrics—such as latency, key size, and energy consumption—
shape the practical deployment of PQC. These insights
are essential for application-specific algorithm selection
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks during the
migration process.
IV. INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS OF PQC
By 2024, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) has moved
beyond theoretical research and is now entering early-stage
industry deployment. Leading financial institutions, tech-
nology firms, and regulatory bodies worldwide are actively
evaluating and piloting quantum-resistant cryptographic
schemes. The driving force behind the transition to PQC
is the long-term risks posed by quantum computing to
classical cryptographic protocols, particularly in sectors such
as financial services, blockchain ecosystems, smart contracts,
and IoT security.
This section provides an overview of current industry
adoption trends and examines real-world cases that highlight
both the opportunities and challenges of integrating PQC.
A. PQC IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND BANKING
Financial institutions are among the earliest adopters of
PQC, recognizing the critical need to secure interbank
communications and transaction systems against emerging
quantum threats. Notably, JPMorgan Chase has initiated
pilot projects that combine classical cryptographic protocols
with post-quantum algorithms in a hybrid approach. For
example, JPMorgan Chase has tested a hybrid key exchange
mechanism that integrates elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
(ECDH) with the lattice-based scheme Kyber to enhance the
security of its interbank messaging systems [17]. Similarly,
Visa has announced collaborations with industry leaders such
as IBM and Microsoft to explore the implementation of
PQC in secure payment gateways, aiming to future-proof
transaction systems against quantum attacks [18].
These industry efforts align closely with international
standardization milestones, such as NIST’s ongoing PQC
algorithm selection process and ETSI’s interoperability test
initiatives, as depicted in Figure 1.
1) INTERBANK COMMUNICATION SECURITY
Financial institutions are investing in PQC-based secure
communication strategies. Hybrid encryption models, which
combine classical and post-quantum primitives, have been
proposed to enhance the security of interbank messaging.
For instance, the integration of CRYSTALS-Dilithium for
digital signatures with CRYSTALS-Kyberfor key exchange
has been demonstrated in pilot projects, where a hybrid
TLS 1.3 handshake was implemented to maintain forward
secrecy while mitigating quantum risks [14]. Preliminary
assessments suggest that such hybrid approaches can improve
resilience against quantum attacks while maintaining accept-
able latency.
2) QUANTUM-SECURE BANKING INFRASTRUCTURE
Modern banking infrastructure is exploring the integration
of PQC to strengthen authentication and transaction verifi-
cation. Recent case studies reveal that enterprise-grade sys-
tems, including mainframes and hardware security modules
(HSMs), can incorporate post-quantum digital signatures to
secure critical operations. For example, Entrust has reported
successful trials integrating PQC signatures for secure boot
mechanisms and transaction signing in high-value banking
operations, thereby enhancing system integrity [19].

Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
3) REGULATORY AND INDUSTRY COLLABORATION
Global regulatory agencies and industry consortia are actively
collaborating to define PQC migration strategies. Initiatives
by organizations such as the European Union Agency for
Cybersecurity (ENISA) and the U.S. National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) have spurred the formation
of working groups focused on the impact of PQC on payment
systems and fraud prevention. These collaborative efforts
aim to establish comprehensive guidelines and compliance
frameworks, as reflected in recent joint efforts reported by
Europol and QuantX Security [20], [21].
4) CHALLENGES IN PQC ADOPTION IN FINANCE
Despite promising advantages, the adoption of PQC in
financial services faces several challenges:
• Higher computational demands of certain PQC algo-
rithms may impact real-time financial operations.
• The larger key and signature sizes in PQC schemes can
affect storage efficiency and network bandwidth.
• Evolving PQC standards create regulatory uncertainty,
requiring financial institutions to navigate complex
compliance challenges.
• Ensuring interoperability with legacy systems and
maintaining compatibility between classical and
quantum-resistant protocols remain significant hurdles.
These challenges underscore the need for hybrid cryp-
tographic frameworks that facilitate the gradual integration
of PQC while maintaining performance benchmarks and
regulatory compliance.
B. PQC IN PAYMENT AND CLEARING SYSTEMS
Real-time payment networks and securities clearing systems
require fast and efficient cryptographic verification. Industry
reports indicate that hybrid cryptographic schemes can be
integrated into these systems with manageable performance
trade-offs. For example, pilot implementations in Europe
have demonstrated the use of Kyber-768 for key exchange
and Falcon-512 for digital signatures in payment sys-
tems, achieving quantum-resistant session establishment and
secure transaction processing [22]. These real-world cases
highlight the potential of PQC to enhance the security of
high-throughput financial systems without causing signifi-
cant operational disruptions.
While performance metrics such as handshake delay or
signature verification speed are not always publicly reported,
early trials suggest that these hybrid integrations introduce
under 20% latency overhead in practical deployments.
C. PQC AND BLOCKCHAIN SMART CONTRACTS
Blockchain networks rely on digital signatures for trans-
action validation and consensus, making them particularly
vulnerable to quantum attacks. Several blockchain projects
have begun implementing quantum-resistant alternatives to
mitigate these risks.
The Quantum Resistant Ledger (QRL) is one of the earliest
blockchain projects to adopt post-quantum cryptography,
using the Extended Merkle Signature Scheme for transaction
security. IOTA integrates Winternitz One-Time Signatures
(WOTS) to strengthen its security model. Ethereum research
groups are exploring lattice-based cryptographic schemes,
such as Dilithium and Falcon, for smart contract authentica-
tion and blockchain consensus mechanisms [23].
D. CHALLENGES IN ADAPTING SMART CONTRACTS FOR
PQC
Despite advancements in post-quantum cryptography, smart
contract platforms face several challenges when integrating
PQC.
One major concern is the increased signature size of PQC
schemes, which significantly expands blockchain storage
requirements and may lead to higher transaction costs.
Another challenge is the additional computational load
associated with PQC signature verification, potentially slow-
ing transaction processing speeds. Furthermore, ensuring
backward compatibility with classical cryptographic systems
remains crucial to avoid network disruptions during the
transition period.
Addressing these issues requires protocol-level optimiza-
tions, efficient cryptographic implementations, and adapta-
tions to consensus mechanisms.
Future versions of Ethereum, for instance, may adopt
hybrid digital signature structures that combine BLS sig-
natures with post-quantum alternatives, depending on the
outcome of EIP-3074 and EIP-4337 evolution paths.
E. PQC IN IoT SECURITY
The growing number of IoT devices necessitates crypto-
graphic solutions that offer strong security while main-
taining low computational overhead. Industry research has
demonstrated the feasibility of PQC in embedded sys-
tems, with semiconductor manufacturers such as NXP and
STMicroelectronics conducting case studies on practical
implementations.
PQC-based secure boot mechanisms have been tested
to ensure that only authenticated firmware is executed,
preventing unauthorized modifications. Experimental setups
have also evaluated the use of PQC algorithms for encrypting
data exchanged between IoT devices, reinforcing network
security [24]. Additionally, feasibility studies suggest that
dedicated hardware accelerators can mitigate the compu-
tational burden of PQC algorithms in resource-constrained
environments.
F. REAL-WORLD ADOPTION OF PQC IN BLOCKCHAIN
AND IoT
Multiple real-world systems have begun integrating
post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) primitives to prepare for
future quantum threats.
112968 VOLUME 13, 2025
Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
In the blockchain domain, the Quantum Resistant Ledger
(QRL) project [25] has implemented XMSS hash-based sig-
natures since 2018, making it one of the earliest PQC-secured
public ledgers.
The Ethereum Foundation ’s roadmap includes EIP-
4844 [26], which proposes shard blob transactions as a
precursor to sharding. While not PQC itself, it sets the
foundation for future post-quantum integration, such as
BLS+PQC hybrid signatures.
In China, the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN)
has published pilot deployment reports using PQC-secured
TLS channels based on CRYSTALS-Kyber [27], indicating
industrial-scale transition readiness.
In the IoT sector, IOTAemploys the Winternitz One-Time
Signature (WOTS) scheme within its Tangle architecture
for transaction authentication, offering quantum-resilient
integrity in smart cities [28].
Hardware vendors are also contributing to PQC deploy-
ment. STMicroelectronics has launched PQC-ready secure
elements integrating Dilithium and Falcon into firmware
authentication pipelines for industrial IoT sensors [29].
Meanwhile, NXP Semiconductors highlights the feasi-
bility of PQC schemes on constrained embedded systems,
particularly Kyber and Dilithium, as demonstrated in their
white paper on migration challenges for microcontroller-
based platforms [30].
G. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES AND CONSIDERATIONS
The transition to post-quantum cryptography is actively
progressing, with various industries conducting real-world
applications and proof-of-concept deployments. These early
efforts indicate PQC’s potential to enhance security in
financial transactions, blockchain networks, and IoT infras-
tructures.
Several key areas require further research and opti-
mization. First, reducing computational overhead is critical
for improving the efficiency of PQC implementations in
high-performance settings such as banking and large-scale
IoT systems. Second, hybrid cryptographic frameworks must
be refined to enable a seamless transition from classi-
cal security protocols to quantum-resistant mechanisms,
ensuring interoperability between legacy systems and PQC
solutions. Third, regulatory bodies must establish clear
compliance guidelines and standardization frameworks to
support industry-wide adoption of PQC. Finally, foster-
ing collaboration between financial institutions, technology
firms, and cybersecurity researchers will be essential for
advancing PQC development and accelerating its integration
into global security infrastructures.
Despite existing challenges, industry-led research and
pilot projects provide a strong foundation for widespread
PQC adoption. However, achieving a fully quantum-secure
ecosystem will require continued progress in cryptographic
standardization, performance benchmarking, and large-scale
testing to ensure a secure and seamless transition to
post-quantum cryptography across multiple industries.
V. STANDARDIZATION PROGRESS IN 2024: NIST, ETSI,
ISO
The transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) requires
global coordination to ensure secure and efficient adoption.
Key standardization bodies, including NIST, ETSI, ISO/IEC,
IETF, and ENISA, are actively working to define PQC
protocols, migration strategies, and security guidelines. This
section provides an overview of their efforts, covering
finalized standards, ongoing evaluations, and challenges in
achieving interoperability and large-scale adoption.
The chronological development of these standardization
efforts is visually summarized in Figure 1, which outlines
key milestones from the initial NIST competition rounds
to recent publications by ETSI and ISO. This timeline
helps contextualize how international organizations are
coordinating efforts to guide the secure adoption of PQC.
A. KEY STANDARDIZATION BODIES
Several international organizations are at the forefront of PQC
standardization. In the United States, the National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) is leading a multi-year
standardization effort through a public competition that
began in 2016. The European Telecommunications Stan-
dards Institute (ETSI) is focusing on developing migration
strategies and integrating PQC into communication systems.
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) are
working together to ensure international adoption of PQC
standards. Meanwhile, the Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF) is defining PQC applications in Internet security
protocols, and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity
(ENISA) is assisting the European Commission in PQC
transition planning.
B. NIST STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS
In August 2024, NIST officially published its first set of
post-quantum cryptographic standards after six years of
evaluation. The final selection comprises ML-KEM, a key
encapsulation mechanism built upon CRYSTALS-Kyber, and
ML-DSA, a lattice-based digital signature standard derived
from CRYSTALS-Dilithium. Additionally, a stateless hash-
based digital signature scheme employing SPHINCS + has
been standardized. These protocols are intended to replace
conventional RSA and ECC systems, providing security
levels comparable to AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256
(corresponding to 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit symmetric
security, respectively).
Beyond the finalized standards, NIST is actively evaluating
further post-quantum cryptographic schemes for potential
future adoption. Among these candidates is FN-DSA, a pro-
posed digital signature mechanism based on FALCON, which
is expected to advance to the next phase of standardization.
Furthermore, code-based schemes such as Classic McEliece
and learning-based key encapsulation mechanisms like
BIKE and HQC remain under consideration. Their eventual

inclusion depends on additional cryptanalysis and perfor-
mance evaluations.
C. ETSI STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS
The ETSI Quantum-Safe Cryptography (QSC) working
group is formulating strategies to ease the transition to
post-quantum cryptography (PQC) across diverse sectors.
Their recent document, ETSI TR 104 016 V1.1.1, lays
out a systematic approach for migration planning. Besides
establishing best practices, ETSI is investigating hybrid cryp-
tographic methods that combine traditional and post-quantum
techniques to secure long-term protection. Moreover, the
group is engaged in incorporating PQC into protocols such
as TLS, 5G, and IoT security frameworks, an effort that will
necessitate updating current communication standards.
D. ISO/IEC STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS
ISO and IEC, through the JTC1 SC27 subcommittee, are
aligning their cryptographic standards with recommendations
from NIST. The ISO/IEC 14888-4:2024 standard, which
defines stateful hash-based digital signatures, is one of the
first PQC-related standards to be formally adopted. Ongoing
discussions are focused on including lattice-based and hash-
based cryptographic schemes such as Kyber, Dilithium, and
Falcon in future versions of ISO 14888 and ISO 18033.
These efforts aim to ensure that PQC adoption is globally
coordinated and adheres to internationally accepted security
practices.
E. OPEN ISSUES AND EMERGING TRENDS
Despite significant progress in PQC standardization, several
challenges remain. One of the primary concerns is hardware
and software optimization, as many PQC algorithms require
substantial computational resources (e.g., additional RAM in
kilobytes or longer execution time in milliseconds), which
may impact performance on resource-constrained devices.
Ensuring seamless migration from classical to post-quantum
cryptographic systems presents another challenge, particu-
larly in industries that rely on long-term cryptographic infras-
tructures, such as financial services and telecommunications.
Additionally, ongoing cryptanalysis is essential to refine PQC
algorithms and address potential vulnerabilities that may
emerge as quantum computing technology advances.
A critical aspect of PQC standardization moving forward
is the development of a cross-national standard integration
mechanism. Such an approach would facilitate the mutual
recognition of PQC standards across different regions,
ensuring interoperability and regulatory alignment. Efforts
to harmonize standards between organizations such as NIST,
ETSI, and ISO/IEC will be crucial to establishing a cohesive
global security framework. Furthermore, international collab-
orations aimed at joint certification and compliance initiatives
can help streamline the deployment of PQC across multiple
industries. Encouraging cross-border research and knowl-
edge sharing will accelerate technological advancements and
improve the efficiency of PQC implementations.
Building on these standardization insights, the next section
proposes a Hybrid Cryptographic Framework designed to
align with current global standards and support phased
integration of PQC into legacy infrastructures.
By 2025 and 2026, additional PQC standards are expected
to be finalized, further reinforcing the security of digi-
tal infrastructures worldwide. The continued evolution of
standardization efforts, combined with advancements in
hardware acceleration and cryptographic optimization, will
play a vital role in ensuring a secure transition to post-
quantum cryptography. Achieving this goal will require
close collaboration among governments, industry leaders,
and academic researchers to address the complexities of PQC
deployment and establish a future-proof security landscape.
VI. PROPOSED HYBRID CRYPTOGRAPHIC FRAMEWORK
(HCF)
A. MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND
The rapid advancement of quantum computing poses a
significant threat to classical cryptographic primitives, neces-
sitating a transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).
However, directly replacing existing cryptographic systems
with PQC algorithms introduces compatibility challenges and
performance trade-offs. Hybrid cryptographic frameworks
offer a practical solution by integrating both classical and
PQC schemes, allowing for a smoother transition while
maintaining compatibility with legacy systems.
Several industry initiatives have explored hybrid
approaches. Cloudflare has piloted PQC integration in TLS
1.3, Google has experimented with hybrid QUIC protocols,
and Microsoft has assessed PQC adoption in Trusted
Platform Modules (TPMs). Building on these efforts, this
study proposes a Hybrid Cryptographic Framework (HCF)
that combines classical elliptic curve cryptography with
NIST-recommended PQC schemes.
B. QUANTUM THREAT MODEL AND SECURITY
ASSUMPTIONS
The security of the proposed framework is analyzed within
a quantum-enhanced adversarial model, which extends
classical security assumptions to address the threats posed by
quantum computing.
This model assumes an adversary with access to quantum
polynomial-time (QPT) computational resources, capable of
leveraging quantum algorithms such as Shor’s and Grover’s
to break conventional cryptographic schemes. The security
analysis is based on the following key assumptions:
• Quantum-resistant key exchange mechanisms must
satisfy the indistinguishability under adaptive chosen-
ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2), ensuring that an
attacker cannot extract secret information through
adaptive queries.
• Post-quantum digital signatures must achieve exis-
tential unforgeability under chosen-message attacks
(EUF-CMA), guaranteeing that attackers cannot
112970 VOLUME 13, 2025
Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
produce valid signatures even after obtaining several
signed messages.
In addition, practical implementations of post-quantum
cryptographic algorithms must mitigate side-channel vulner-
abilities, such as those exploited through timing discrepancies
and cache-based attacks. To counter these risks, it is essential
to employ security measures like masking techniques and
constant-time execution.
These requirements align with existing research on com-
posable security frameworks for post-quantum cryptography,
ensuring that the proposed system is resilient to both classical
and quantum adversaries.
C. HYBRID KEY EXCHANGE MECHANISM
The proposed HCF utilizes a hybrid key exchange mechanism
that integrates Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral
(ECDHE) with Kyber-768, a post-quantum key encapsulation
mechanism. The session key is derived using a cryptographic
key derivation function :
Kfinal = HKDF(Extract(KECDHE), Expand(KKyber), L) (2)
This approach ensures that session keys remain secure even
if classical key exchange mechanisms are compromised by
quantum adversaries. The use of HKDF for key derivation
is standard in cryptographic protocols such as TLS 1.3,
providing a secure method to derive session keys from
multiple sources [31], [32].
The security of the hybrid key exchange mechanism is
formally expressed as :
AdvHKE ≤ min(AdvECDHE, AdvKyber) + qHKDF
2256 (3)
This bound indicates that the security of the final session
key is at least as strong as the most secure component in the
hybrid exchange. Even if ECDHE is broken, Kyber ensures
that the session remains protected [33].
D. HYBRID DIGITAL SIGNATURE SCHEME
To ensure authentication and integrity, the proposed frame-
work employs a dual-signature scheme that combines classi-
cal and post-quantum signatures. This mechanism enhances
security by requiring both classical and post-quantum signa-
ture verification:
Verify(m) = VerifyDilithium(H(m), σpq)
∧ VerifyECDSA(H(m), σc) (4)
This expression indicates that the security of the final
session key is at least as strong as the most secure component
in the hybrid exchange. Even if ECDHE is broken, Kyber
ensures that the session remains protected [33].
In this scheme, σpq represents the Dilithium-based post-
quantum signature, while σc denotes the classical ECDSA
signature. Both signatures must be valid for authentication
to succeed. This approach ensures resilience against quan-
tum attacks while maintaining compatibility with existing
cryptographic infrastructures. This scheme ensures that
authentication remains valid even if classical signatures are
compromised by quantum attacks.
E. BLOCKCHAIN INTEGRATION AND PQC-MERKLE TREES
Blockchain security is particularly vulnerable to quantum
advancements due to its reliance on elliptic curve signatures.
To enhance blockchain integrity, the proposed hybrid crypto-
graphic framework incorporates a post-quantum Merkle tree
structure.
Transaction verification in this scheme is based on
post-quantum signatures embedded within a hash-based
Merkle tree [11], [33]. The construction follows the
equations:
Leaf = Hash(TxID ∥ σDilithium)
Root = CRH(σ1 ∥ σ2 ∥ · · · ∥σn)
This structure ensures quantum-safe transaction validation
while reducing storage requirements compared to hash-based
signature schemes. Additionally, the logarithmic verification
complexity of Merkle proofs makes it computationally
feasible for real-world blockchain implementations.
F. PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND THEORETICAL
ESTIMATION
Since no empirical results are currently available, a theo-
retical estimation of computational costs is presented. The
key exchange process is evaluated based on cycle counts for
classical and post-quantum operations [34], [35], [36], [37],
[38]:
TECDHE ≈ 1.2 × 106 cycles
TKyber ≈ 4.8 × 105 cycles
These results suggest that Kyber-based key exchange is
computationally more efficient than elliptic curve cryptogra-
phy (ECC), while maintaining quantum resilience.
In addition, certificate size is analyzed to assess storage
overhead. The hybrid certificate consists of both classical and
post-quantum components:
CertSize = 512B + 2592B + 128B = 3232B (5)
While larger than traditional ECC certificates, the addi-
tional size is justified by the long-term security benefits
provided by post-quantum authentication.
G. STANDARDIZATION AND DEPLOYMENT
CONSIDERATIONS
The transition from classical cryptography to post-quantum
cryptographic solutions requires a phased migration strategy.
The proposed framework aligns with NIST PQC recommen-
dations and industry best practices, ensuring interoperability
while mitigating security risks associated with quantum
advancements.
To guide this transition, a heuristic trigger mechanism is
proposed, based on quantifiable cryptographic and hardware
indicators. Specifically, the system evaluates two conditions:
VOLUME 13, 2025 112971
Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
(1) the number of operational qubits in quantum computers,
and (2) the quantified advantage of an adversary in breaking
Kyber.
Trigger =
{
Disable ECDHE, if #Qubits ≥ 106
Full PQC, if AdvKyber ≤ 2−128
(6)
The rationale for these thresholds is as follows: if quantum
computers reach one million qubits, it is expected that Shor’s
algorithm could feasibly break elliptic curve-based schemes
like ECDHE, necessitating their deprecation. Conversely,
if the adversarial advantage Adv Kyber is no greater than 2 −128,
Kyber achieves 128-bit post-quantum security, satisfying
NIST long-term cryptographic strength requirements.
This dual-condition trigger provides a structured and quan-
titative foundation for transitioning to full PQC adoption,
while also accommodating interim hybrid deployments.
The effectiveness of these thresholds depends on advance-
ments in quantum hardware and cryptanalytic techniques,
requiring continuous reassessment.
H. DISCRETE MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION FOR PQC
PARAMETER SELECTION
To support practical deployment decisions in constrained
environments, we propose a discrete multi-objective opti-
mization framework for selecting post-quantum crypto-
graphic (PQC) algorithms. Each candidate algorithm is
evaluated by three criteria: latency T (x), storage cost
S(x), and energy consumption E(x), subject to a minimum
quantum security level σ(x) ≥ 128 bits.
Let the candidate set be :
A = {Kyber-768, Dilithium-3, Falcon-512}.
The optimization problem is formulated as :
min
x∈A
(
T (x), S(x), E(x)
)
,
subject to σ(x) ≥ 128. (7)
Due to the discrete, non-differentiable nature of the design
space, we use the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
II (NSGA-II) to identify the Pareto front of optimal trade-offs.
1) NORMALIZATION AND SCORING (OPTIONAL)
Each metric is normalized via min-max scaling :
˜T (x) = T (x) − Tmin
Tmax − Tmin
, ˜S(x) = S(x) − Smin
Smax − Smin
,
˜E(x) = E(x) − Emin
Emax − Emin
.
An optional aggregate score is computed as :
Score(x) = w1 ˜T (x) + w2 ˜S(x) + w3 ˜E(x),
where the weights reflect application-specific priorities or
can be determined via the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).
2) OPTIMIZATION PROCEDURE
• Input: A, σmin = 128, population size N, generations
G
• Output: Pareto-optimal subset P ⊆ A
1) Initialize random population P0 ⊆ A.
2) Evaluate T (x), S(x), E(x) and filter x with σ(x) < 128.
3) For g = 1 to G:
• Apply non-dominated sorting and compute crowding
distance.
• Use tournament selection and discrete muta-
tion/crossover.
• Evaluate offspring; update population.
4) Return final non-dominated set PG.
3) DATA SOURCES AND REPRODUCIBILITY
Latency and storage values are drawn from Table 5, based
on TLS and blockchain benchmarks using PQClean and
DISBench on an Intel Xeon E5-2650. Energy data in Table 6
comes from open IoT hardware experiments [14], [15].
4) USE CASE INTERPRETATION
The Pareto front assists system designers in selecting
appropriate PQC schemes: Falcon-512 minimizes latency
and energy for IoT, Kyber-768 offers efficient KEM for
secure networking, and Dilithium-3 balances security and
performance.
FIGURE 3. Security-performance trade-off among PQC schemes:
normalized cost vs. NIST level.
Figure 3 shows the relative positions of Kyber-768,
Dilithium-3, and Falcon-512 on the security-performance
plane. Falcon-512 excels in efficiency (NIST-1), Kyber-768
provides balance, and Dilithium-3 offers stronger (Level 2)
security with moderate cost.
5) COMPARISON WITH CLASSICAL AND OTHER PQC
SCHEMES
To contextualize our selections, Table 7 compares PQC can-
didates with classical algorithms (RSA, ECC) and alternative
schemes (SPHINCS+, McEliece).

TABLE 7. Comparison of classical and post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.
The selected lattice-based schemes outperform McEliece
and SPHINCS + in size and efficiency, while providing
robust security against quantum attacks. This validates
their suitability for integration into hybrid cryptographic
frameworks.
I. OBSTACLES AND PROSPECTIVE RESEARCH AREAS
The hybrid cryptographic framework presents several imple-
mentation challenges and open research questions that must
be addressed for practical deployment.
One significant challenge is side-channel resistance. While
the proposed framework guarantees theoretical security,
practical implementations may still be vulnerable to side-
channel threats, such as timing analysis and cache-based
exploits. Future research should focus on assessing the
impact of these vulnerabilities on lattice-based schemes and
developing effective countermeasures, including masking
techniques, constant-time implementations, and secure hard-
ware modules.
Integrating hybrid cryptographic schemes into existing
systems requires a detailed examination of their compatibility
with established cryptographic infrastructures, such as TLS,
X.509, and blockchain consensus mechanisms. Investigations
into protocol adaptation, key management, and secure
handshake mechanisms are essential for enabling practical
adoption.
Optimizing hybrid cryptographic frameworks for resource-
constrained environments is another critical area of focus,
as increased computational and storage overhead may
affect performance in IoT, edge computing, and mobile
settings. Further studies should explore efficient software
implementations, algorithmic optimizations, and hardware
acceleration techniques, such as FPGA- and ASIC-based
approaches.
Moreover, additional research is required to refine hybrid
migration strategies, assess long-term cryptographic agility,
and evaluate the security implications in multi-party com-
munication scenarios. As standardization bodies continue
to update PQC transition plans, ongoing studies must
ensure that hybrid frameworks remain adaptable to emerging
cryptographic requirements.
Overall, the proposed framework offers a structured
method for integrating hybrid cryptography while addressing
security challenges and deployment issues. Future work
should focus on real-world adoption strategies and refining
security mechanisms to ensure long-term viability in crypto-
graphic infrastructures.
J. PRACTICAL DEPLOYMENT CONTEXTS
The proposed Hybrid Cryptographic Framework (HCF) is
designed not merely as a theoretical abstraction, but as
a deployable architecture tailored for real-world crypto-
graphic systems. Its modular structure—including hybrid key
exchange, dual-signature authentication, and post-quantum-
compatible Merkle trees—is readily compatible with widely
used standards such as TLS 1.3, blockchain consensus layers,
and X.509 certificate infrastructures (see Sections VI).
For instance, in blockchain ecosystems such as Ethereum
rollups or permissioned ledgers, the dual-signature mech-
anism enables backward compatibility with existing
ECDSA-based consensus protocols while introducing
post-quantum resilience via Dilithium [11]. In embedded IoT
environments, the hybrid key exchange protocol (ECDHE +
Kyber-768) supports quantum-safe session key establishment
without sacrificing compatibility, enabling secure firmware
updates even under constrained energy and memory budgets
(see Section VI).
The discrete multi-objective optimization model intro-
duced in Section VI-H serves as a decision-support tool for
engineers deploying PQC in constrained devices. It allows
the selection of candidate algorithms (e.g., Falcon for energy-
efficiency, Kyber for speed) based on quantified trade-offs in
latency, memory footprint, and energy consumption.
All core components of HCF are compatible with exist-
ing secure hardware, including cryptographic coprocessors
and secure enclaves found in STMicroelectronics STSAFE
modules [29] and NXP’s LPC55S6x MCU series [30]. These
alignments ensure that the framework can be realistically
adopted across current industrial cryptographic deployments.
In summary, the HCF architecture bridges formal cryp-
tographic design and engineering feasibility, offering a
structured and standards-aligned path for transitioning to
quantum-resilient cryptographic systems.
VII. CHALLENGES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF
POST-QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY
Quantum computing poses a serious threat to traditional
cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECC through
VOLUME 13, 2025 112973
Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
algorithms like Shor’s algorithm. The transition to post-
quantum cryptography (PQC) is a global endeavor that
requires a detailed analysis of computational overhead,
storage impact, and efforts toward international standard-
ization. This section discusses the primary obstacles to
PQC adoption, real-world implementation cases, simulation-
based performance evaluations, and strategies for standard
harmonization.
A. TECHNICAL CHALLENGES IN PQC ADOPTION
Post-quantum cryptographic schemes introduce trade-offs
between security, efficiency, and resource requirements. The
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has
selected Kyber for key encapsulation along with Dilithium
and Falcon for digital signatures as part of its PQC
standardization process [39]. Despite these advancements,
these schemes impose significantly higher computational
and storage costs compared to classical cryptographic
approaches.
1) VULNERABILITIES IN PQC SCHEMES
While post-quantum cryptographic algorithms like Kyber,
Dilithium, and Falcon offer resistance to quantum adver-
saries, they remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks. These
attacks exploit physical leaks, such as timing variations or
power consumption patterns, to extract sensitive information,
even in quantum-resistant systems. Lattice-based schemes
like Kyber and Dilithium are particularly susceptible to
timing attacks, where variations in computation time during
encryption or decryption processes could be used to infer
private keys. To mitigate such risks, it is critical to imple-
ment constant-time algorithms and utilize secure hardware
solutions like Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), which
are designed to prevent information leakage through physical
side-channels.
2) NIST’s REJECTION OF RAINBOW ROUND 4
In the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization
Process, Rainbow, a multivariate signature scheme, was
rejected in Round 4 primarily due to its vulnerability to
multi-target attacks and the large signature size. While
Rainbow demonstrated strong resistance to quantum attacks,
its signature size was impractical for real-world applications,
especially those requiring compact signatures, such as
blockchain and IoT. In addition, Rainbow’s susceptibility to
multi-target algebraic attacks compromised its security, lead-
ing to its rejection by NIST. NIST’s decision to favor other
algorithms like Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon underscores
the importance of balancing security and efficiency when
selecting PQC algorithms for widespread deployment.
3) HARDWARE ACCELERATION AND IoT DEVICE
CONSTRAINTS
We appreciate the reviewer’s comment highlighting the
importance of addressing hardware acceleration needs and
the constraints of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the
deployment of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). These
aspects are crucial in real-world applications, particularly in
resource-constrained environments.
4) HARDWARE ACCELERATION NEEDS
Post-quantum cryptographic schemes often introduce higher
computational overhead compared to classical algorithms,
which may pose challenges in environments where per-
formance is critical. To mitigate these issues, hardware
acceleration is essential for optimizing the performance
of PQC operations. Specialized hardware such as ASICs
(Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) and FPGAs (Field-
Programmable Gate Arrays) have been explored to accelerate
lattice-based schemes like Kyber and Falcon, as well as
hash-based schemes like SPHINCS +. For instance, studies
have shown that hardware acceleration can reduce the latency
and improve the throughput of these algorithms, making them
more feasible for large-scale deployment in industries like
finance and telecommunications.
5) IoT DEVICE CONSTRAINTS
In IoT devices, which typically operate with constrained
resources such as limited memory, processing power, and
battery life, the adoption of PQC faces additional challenges.
For example, schemes like SPHINCS+ require large amounts
of memory and computational power, making them unsuit-
able for low-power and low-memory IoT devices. In contrast,
lattice-based schemes such as Kyber and Dilithium have
been evaluated for their suitability in IoT environments.
These schemes are more energy-efficient and exhibit smaller
memory footprints, making them more practical for IoT
devices. The energy consumption of various PQC operations
in IoT contexts has been benchmarked, and it was found
that Falcon-512, for example, has lower energy requirements
for signature verification compared to other schemes like
SPHINCS+ [40].
We emphasize that ongoing research into hardware
accelerators and lightweight versions of PQC schemes is
critical for making PQC more viable in resource-constrained
environments like IoT. Future work will focus on optimizing
these schemes to meet the specific needs of embedded
systems, ensuring that PQC can be seamlessly integrated
into real-world IoT applications without compromising
performance or security.
B. REAL-WORLD IMPLEMENTATION: JPMorgan CHASE
PQC MIGRATION CASE
JPMorgan Chase has actively pursued PQC adoption for
securing financial transactions by implementing a hybrid
cryptographic framework that integrates Kyber and Dilithium
with traditional ECDSA for interbank communications.
Initial findings indicate a 20% increase in TLS handshake
latency when Kyber is used for key exchange, a three- to
five-fold increase in storage footprint due to the larger public
112974 VOLUME 13, 2025
Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
key size of Dilithium compared to ECC-256, and additional
CPU overhead affecting high-frequency trading operations.
To mitigate these challenges, the bank is exploring hardware
acceleration through FPGA-based cryptographic modules.
1) SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS IN FINANCIAL SYSTEMS
In addition to performance concerns, side-channel attacks
pose a significant threat to financial systems using PQC algo-
rithms. These attacks exploit timing differences and power
consumption patterns during cryptographic operations. For
instance, a timing attack on a lattice-based scheme such as
Kyber could potentially leak sensitive data, including private
keys. Given the high-stakes nature of financial systems,
employing countermeasures like constant-time cryptographic
operations and secure hardware solutions is essential to
mitigate these risks.
C. SIMULATION-BASED ANALYSIS OF PQC
PERFORMANCE
The impact of PQC on blockchain storage and financial trans-
action latency was simulated using Ethereum-like transaction
models and financial systems.
1) BLOCKCHAIN STORAGE OVERHEAD
The effect of PQC on blockchain storage was evaluated
by simulating Ethereum-like transaction models. Table 8
presents storage requirements per block for various crypto-
graphic schemes. While ECDSA-256 requires minimal stor-
age per block, post-quantum schemes impose significantly
higher storage demands. Falcon-512 appears particularly
promising due to its relatively compact signature size and
efficient verification time.
TABLE 8. Blockchain storage overhead for PQC signatures (5000
transactions per block).
2) PQC LATENCY IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS
The impact of PQC on financial transaction latency was
measured, and Table 9 summarizes the results. While ECC-
256 provides minimal latency, hybrid schemes involving
Kyber, Dilithium, or Falcon introduce varying levels of delay.
Falcon-512 demonstrates the most favorable performance
balance, making it suitable for high-frequency financial
applications.
D. CROSS-NATIONAL PQC STANDARDIZATION EFFORTS
PQC standardization remains fragmented, with different
regions pursuing independent approaches. The United States
primarily focuses on Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon through
NIST [39], whereas Europe, through ETSI, promotes BIKE
TABLE 9. Impact of PQC on financial transaction latency and CPU load.
and FrodoKEM for 5G security [41]. Meanwhile, China has
introduced SM9-based quantum-resistant encryption [42].
A unified global PQC framework would be beneficial to
facilitate cross-recognition of cryptographic standards.
Establishing a joint certification body under ISO/IEC JTC1
SC27 could improve global interoperability. Additionally,
hybrid cryptographic policies should be designed to enable
seamless integration between classical and quantum-resistant
systems.
E. UNCERTAINTY IN QUANTUM COMPUTING THREAT
TIMELINES
Estimates for when quantum computers will be able to
break RSA-2048 vary, with projections ranging between
2035 and 2045 [43]. Table 10 outlines projected mile-
stones, highlighting that while current quantum processors,
such as IBM Osprey and Google Sycamore, have limited
impact on cryptographic security, future large-scale quantum
processors may pose a significant threat to conventional
algorithms.
TABLE 10. Projected timeline of quantum threats to cryptography.
F. SECURITY CHALLENGES IN POST-QUANTUM
CRYPTOGRAPHY
The adoption of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algo-
rithms is essential for quantum resilience, but it introduces
several security challenges. This section discusses the
vulnerabilities of PQC schemes to side-channel attacks and
examines the implications of NIST’s rejection of the Rainbow
scheme.
1) SIDE-CHANNEL ATTACKS IN PQC
Although Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon are quantum-
resistant, they remain vulnerable to side-channel attacks.
These attacks exploit physical leaks, such as variations in
timing or power consumption, to extract sensitive informa-
tion. Lattice-based schemes, such as Kyber and Dilithium,
are particularly susceptible to timing attacks, where attackers
may deduce private keys by analyzing computation time
variations [44]. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, it is
crucial to implement constant-time execution and deploy
cryptographic hardware solutions, such as Hardware Security
Modules (HSMs).
VOLUME 13, 2025 112975
Y. Wang, E. S. Ismail: Review on the Advances, Applications, and Future Prospects of PQC
2) NIST’S REJECTION OF RAINBOW IN ROUND 4
Rainbow, a multivariate-based scheme, was rejected dur-
ing Round 4 of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
Standardization Process due to its large signature size and
vulnerability to multi-target attacks [45]. Despite being
resistant to quantum attacks, Rainbow’s impractical signature
sizes and security weaknesses made it unsuitable for real-
world applications, particularly those requiring compact
signatures, such as blockchain and IoT.
G. FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
While the adoption of PQC is essential, significant challenges
remain in computation, standardization, and interoperability.
Future research should focus on: - Optimizing hybrid
PQC frameworks for practical deployment. - Leveraging
cryptanalysis techniques to evaluate emerging vulnerabilities.
- Enhancing international cooperation to develop unified
certification and compliance frameworks.
Advancements in these areas will be crucial for ensur-
ing a secure and seamless transition to post-quantum
cryptography.
VIII. CONCLUSION
This study provides a thorough review of the transition
to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and its implica-
tions for securing critical infrastructures, including finance,
blockchain, and IoT networks. Our analysis shows that
while PQC schemes offer strong security against quantum
adversaries, they often impose higher computational, storage,
and bandwidth demands compared to classical cryptography.
This trade-off requires careful optimization, particularly in
resource-constrained and latency-sensitive environments.
The global landscape of PQC standardization remains
fragmented. While NIST emphasizes lattice-based schemes
such as Kyber and Dilithium, ETSI promotes alternatives like
code-based BIKE, and other jurisdictions explore hash- and
multivariate-based primitives. This divergence underscores
the urgent need for a globally harmonized PQC standard to
ensure cross-border interoperability and reduce fragmenta-
tion risks.
Hybrid cryptographic frameworks that integrate classical
and post-quantum primitives offer a practical transitional
approach. By maintaining compatibility with existing infras-
tructures while gradually introducing quantum-resistant
components, these frameworks allow for stepwise adoption
and risk management during the standardization delay.
From a physical deployment perspective, PQC introduces
tangible challenges at the hardware level. Embedded systems,
IoT devices, and secure elements must support larger key
sizes and increased algorithmic complexity within tight
energy, thermal, and memory limits. Our performance
analysis (Section VI) suggests that lattice-based schemes like
Kyber and Falcon can be efficiently implemented on micro-
controllers when supported by cryptographic accelerators and
secure enclaves.
Furthermore, physical-layer security—including protec-
tion against side-channel attacks (e.g., timing, power anal-
ysis) and fault injection—must be closely integrated with
algorithmic design. Constant-time implementations, secure
bootloaders, and hardware-level masking techniques will
be essential in ensuring the practical resilience of PQC.
These factors reinforce the importance of designing quantum
resilience across both software and hardware.
Looking forward, future research should focus on
co-optimizing PQC schemes for embedded and distributed
systems, accelerating global alignment on interoperable
standards, and developing practical deployment strategies
that consider both algorithmic efficiency and physical
constraints. While the transition to PQC presents substantial
challenges, the integration of hybrid architectures, hardware
advancements, and collaborative standardization efforts will
be crucial for establishing a quantum-secure cryptographic
ecosystem.
